## Launcher Question:

Do Christians lack ambition?

## Passage

Read Mark 8:34-38

## Questions

1. Who does the passage say will lose their lives?
2. Who does the passage say will save their lives?
3. What does this passage say Jesus' disciples are supposed to be like or supposed to not be like?
4. What does gaining the world look like?
5. What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?
6. To be a Christian does someone have to be prepared to give up their hopes, dreams and ambitions in life? What is included in denying yourself?
7. Is this what society says we should do? What excuses can we use to not follow this teaching of denying ourselves?

Christians may appear to lack ambition from a worldly sense if they live out these verses, because they'll be denying themselves the things this world values, but it's not that they're deliberately lacking ambition, rather it's that their ambition is the Gospel, and to save their life through giving it up.

8. If necessary split into groups and discuss one or more of the following situations and how this passage applies. If possible try to include nuance:
	- Laura has just been offered a promotion at work. There is a payrise and a nice pathway to keep progressing her career at the place she's at. Unfortunately the promotion also requires she works an additional hour in the afternoon each day. She currently volunteers at youth each Friday night from 7pm and has some strong connections with the group of youth girls in her growth group. The extra hour of work means she'll be at least an hour late for youth on a Friday night. What would you do if you were Laura?
	- David and Sindhu have been dating for 3 years and live together in a sexual relationship. David has just recently become a Christian, although Sindhu is not a Christian. What would you do if you were David?
	- Jason has just started playing representative football and the team trains Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights. Unfortunately Jason has bible study on the Wednesday night at the same time as his football training. Jason is a close friend of yours and you're in the same bible study. What would you do if you were Jason?

We are often good at recognising how other people can, or should, deny themselves, but it's sometimes a lot harder to deny ourselves. It's important to keep Jesus' teaching in Matthew 7:1-5 in mind and try to instead self-reflect and see what ways we can deny ourselves rather than what others should deny themselves.
