# Getting Started

Read Matthew 13:44-46. Why, in your opinion, did Jesus tell the parable found there?

# Reflection

Would you describe yourself as an "heroic" person? Do you think that you are really here for a purpose greater than yourself?

# Discussion

1. Ignatius appears to have often been impetuous, driven by enthusiasm out of his new-found passion for Christ. Discuss the relative importance of fervent passion, adventurous enthusiasm, wise caution, astute planning and bold risk-taking in:
    * the life of following Jesus
    * your life
    * the work of the Church
    * taking the Gospel to others
2. Dana Robert, Chris Lowney and Tim Kesicki all make the important point that Ignatius gathered around him a group, a band of brothers eventually forming the Jesuits, as he began his task of mission to the ends of the earth. Why was and is such a community an important step for discipleship and the work of mission? Reflect on this in the light of Luke 6:12-15.
3. Chris Lowney refers to four aspects about effective leadership that he believes can be learnt from the Jesuits:
    1. self-awareness
    2. ingenuity
    3. heroism
    4. love

    Discuss these four qualities in light of Jesus' words about 'greatness' in Matthew 20:20-28.

4. How do you respond to Chris Lowney's definition of heroism: *"that fundamentally you'd live in such a way that you cared about something bigger than yourself"*?
5. Mark Noll observes that the Jesuits were boldly prepared to go out beyond the protection of European Christian political power in taking the Gospel to the ends of the earth. How much do you think that the risk-aversion society in which we live has infected followers of Jesus, and hindered the spread of the Gospel today?
6. Dana Robert suggests that the *"intense spirituality"* of the Jesuits enabled them to survive in any worldly setting. Read Romans 12:1-2. What kind of spiritual practices do we need to survive as Jesus' people in our current setting so that we are less likely to be squeezed into the world's mould?
7. Read John 15:18-20, 16:31-33; 1 John 2:15-17. What do you think about Tim Kesicki's assertion about the Jesuits, that *"'the world is good' ... Ignatius said 'no, go live in the world, and that everything in the world can be used for good.' ... So, he loved the world."*
