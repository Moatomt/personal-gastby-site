Rather than seeing them as wanting to withdraw and isolate, we discover that they were instrumental in taking the Gospel to England and Europe in the 6th-10th centuries AD. This is especially the case with Irish monasticism, beginning with Patrick. The establishment of this 'Celtic' expression of Christianity proved to be a fertile ground for a line of Irish missionary monks - St. Patrick, St. Aidan, St. Columbus, St. Columbanus, St. Boniface.`}</p>\n    <p>{`These monks bravely carried the Christian message to what was then 'pagan' Europe - Scotland, England, France, Germany, Scandinavia. They did so in the face of great physical danger, both natural and human-made. Whether facing Viking attacks on their monasteries, or confronting pagan religious powers, they gave birth to vibrant, transformational, reproducing Christian communities across the western European continent.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Their missionary strategy? It was simple yet powerful: `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`to plant communities of dedicated people, monasteries, ... to show a local community by teaching, integrity of life and example of living what the Christian faith should mean. So, at their best, the monasteries were not just declarations of the Christian faith but exemplifications of the Christian faith.\"`}</em>{` `}{`[`}{`Mark Noll`}{`]`}</p>\n    <p>{`There are, doubtless, lessons we can learn from these monks as we too face the challenge of taking the message of Jesus to the ends of the earth, especially in a re-paganised Western culture.`}</p>\n    <h1>{`Getting Started`}</h1>\n    <p>{`When you think of monks, what characteristics have typically come to your mind?`}</p>\n    <p>{`Have there been aspects of the stories in this episode that have surprised you?`}</p>\n    <h1>{`Reflection`}</h1>\n    <p>{`Read Ephesians 2:1-13; 1 Peter 1:13-2:3.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The letters of Paul and Peter in the New Testament were written to people whose way of life had been turned around by Jesus Christ whom they followed as Lord. Think about how the truths in these verses were exemplified in some of the stories from this episode.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Do you thin, that, like the Christianised Roman Empire, we in the West can tend to believe that Christianity is coterminous (linked) with the West, and so tend to ignore what is happening in the rest of the world?`}</p>\n    <h1>{`Discussion`}</h1>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`How do you respond to the narrative of this episode, that in many ways, Celtic `}{`[`}{`Irish`}{`]`}{` Christianity 'saved' Europe for the Christian faith?`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Mark Noll indicates that the Irish monks did some \"pretty wild things\" in their missionary work.

In the coming weeks, try setting aside one or more times for a significant period of prayer and reflection (say at least half an hour) in a quiet, natural setting. Leave your phone off for that period. At the end of this time, note any matters about God, self, others that come to mind.`}</p>\n\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      ","import React from 'react'\n\nconst BannerLanding = props => (\n  <section id=\"banner\" className=\"style2\">\n    <div className=\"inner\">\n      <header className=\"major\">\n        <h1>Moatomt</h1>\n      </header>\n      <div className=\"content\">\n        <p>\n          Built with Gatsby (which uses react) and a site template by HTML5UP.\n          This site is compiled into static pages and served via Github Pages\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n)\n\nexport default BannerLanding\n","import React from 'react'\nimport Helmet from 'react-helmet'\nimport Layout from '../components/Layout'\nimport BannerLanding from '../components/BannerLanding'\n\nclass MarkDownViewer extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Layout>\n        <Helmet\n          title={this.props.meta.name + ' - Moatomt'}\n          meta={[\n            {\n              name: 'description',\n              content: 'Welcome to my blog where I document my learning',\n            },\n            { name: 'keywords', content: 'Moatomt, Blog, Bible Studies' },\n          ]}\n        ></Helmet>\n        <BannerLanding />\n        <div id=\"main\">\n          <section id=\"one\">\n            <div className=\"inner\">\n              <header className=\"major\">\n                <h1>{this.props.meta.name}</h1>\n              </header>\n              {this.props.children}\n            </div>\n          </section>\n        </div>\n      </Layout>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MarkDownViewer\n","export default function _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) {\n  if (source == null) return {};\n  var target = {};\n  var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source);\n  var key, i;\n\n  for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) {\n    key = sourceKeys[i];\n    if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue;\n    target[key] = source[key];\n  }\n\n  return target;\n}"],"names":["meta","name","date","Date","week","_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXLayout","DefaultLayout","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","parentName","isMDXComponent","id","className","MarkDownViewer","render","title","this","content","children","React","_objectWithoutPropertiesLoose","source","excluded","key","i","target","sourceKeys","Object","keys","length","indexOf"],"sourceRoot":""}
