# Requirements
To develop with Gatsby you'll need the following software:
* Node.js
* Git
* Gatsby CLI

## Node.js

To download node, I used nvm, that way I can keep up to date with different versions.
Nvm stands for Node Version Manager and can be found on [github](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
I'm on linux at the moment so I can download it following the instructions on the github's readme, 
but for windows, you may have to try something else.

Once nvm was installed, I installed the latest lts of Node with `nvm install --lts` and was able 
to see the remote versions available with `nvm ls-remote`. 
You can list current local versions by `nvm list` and see the current by `nvm current`. 
Once you do `nvm use lts/fermium`, where 'fermium' is the name of your release, any use of npm or
node should be the version selected via npm.

## Git

Git is pretty self explanatory. Download it from the internet as an exe on windows or though 
your package manager on linux

## Gatsby CLI

Gatsby can be installed through npm.

`npm install -g gatsby-cli`

The `-g` tag makes it install globally, rather than just in the current directory and is preferable
to allow command-line utilities so that their executable components are available in the system path.

# Creating a new site

You can create a new site after navigating to a directory that you want to put your source code folder
in. Then type in the command line: `gatsby new` and the prompts will direct you.

To then run your site locally, navigate into that newly created directory and either run one of the
following:
* `gastby develop`
* `npm run develop`

After running the command, the site should be accessible at http://localhost:8000

    name: "Gatsby Setup",
    date: new Date("2021-07-13")
}
