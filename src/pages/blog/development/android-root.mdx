# Unlocking the boot loader

Credit where credit is due I followed the following [guide](https://youtu.be/UVKUDZSyjW4) on youtube. You're going to need a laptop where you can download some tools (android tools). So first things first on my phone I 
* Enabled developer tools by clicking the kernel version 10 times or something
* Enabled OEM unlocking  and USB debugging in Developer options
* Plugged in to my computer
* Turned off my phone and restarted it in fastboot mode (it'll go to a weird technical looking screen and wait). To restart in fastboot mode, hold down the power button and the volume down button.

During this time on my computer I didn't need to install any [motorolla drivers](https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/88481) as I'm on Linux. Instead I installed the [platform tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) from Android Studio to use adb and fastboot. I also went to the [motorola website](https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/standalone%2Fbootloader%2Funlock-your-device-a) to get the code to unlock my bootloader. During this process I tried to check my device was connected properly with the command `fastpath devices` but it didn't work and so I had to follow the instructions on [android.com](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device) to add my user to the plugdev group to run the fastboot executable.
```
sudo usermod -aG plugdev $LOGNAME
```
Adding myself to the new user group required a relog so I did that. I also installed the android-sdk-platform-tools-common package for the udev rules. I'm not sure if this was necessary but I did it anyway.

Next I ran
```
./fastboot oem get_unlock_data
```
and then formatted and pasted the data into the [motorola website](https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/standalone%2Fbootloader%2Funlock-your-device-b). To begin with it didn't work, until I registered my device with Motorolla via the same website.

After receiving the code via email. I ran the following command twice with `UNIQUE_KEY` replaced with my actual key.
```
fastboot oem unlock UNIQUE_KEY
```

And that was the bootloader unlocked!

# Download Magisk

I went to the magisk site and downloaded the apk and installed it to my phone. I then tried to patch/flash the rom/os (not sure what the technical name for it is) from within the app by downloading the .zip. That didn't work so I downloaded an image from [TWRP](https://twrp.me/Devices/) for my motorolla g5 and flashed it onto the device with the following commands
```
./adb reboot bootloader
./fastboot flash recover twrp-3.1.1.img
./fastboot boot twrp-3.1.1.1.img
```
Then I used twrp to flash the magisk zip. That worked and then I went into Magisk and installed it fully. I hide it from pokemon go and installed a gps spoofing app. (Specifically [Fake GPS Location - GPS JoyStick](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theappninjas.fakegpsjoystick). I also followed the in-app instructions to side-load a modified version of the app)

# Hide mocking location

From there I losely followed the tutorial here on xda-developers [https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-fake-location-android-gps-spoofing/](https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-fake-location-android-gps-spoofing/), doing the parts I hadn't yet done. I installed the Storage Isolation app, enabled storage isolation on the GPS spoofing app and then installed Smali. I dual-booted into my windows box to use the Smali Patcher and once I generated the zip I copied it on to my android device. From there I flashed it with Twrp again. I launched into twrp by using the command `./adb reboot recovery` on my linux machine again.

I kept having troubles with my player rubber-banding (jumping from the spoofed location to my actual location). I was very confused as to why this was happening, and I finally figured out that you don't need to use the 'Indirect Mocking' feature, which was causing the rubber-banding.

# Adding GPS Routes

From there I grabbed a gpx route for my GPS app so that I had an automatically planned walk. I used the site [https://coords.heber.com.br/en/gpx](https://coords.heber.com.br/en/gpx) to grab one. I also believe the site [https://pogo.arspoofing.com](https://pogo.arspoofing.com) is helpful to find specific pokemon which is what I use the spoofed GPS for.
