Christianity, however, claims the largest number of adherents.`}</p>\n    <p>{`So, what is different about Christian faith in its early and current global, transformative\nreach? A key answer is the one who is the centre of its worship and loyalty, Jesus. From an\nobscure Jewish village in a small first century AD Roman province, Jesus emerged and over a\nthree year period was hailed as the expected Jewish Messiah. There were others who claimed\nthat title. They all faded out or were executed. Their efforts ended there.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In the end, Jesus too was executed by the Romans in a profoundly brutal, shameful way\n(crucifixion). It should have ended there. It didn't. Jesus' followers soon began to\nboldly call all people, not just Jews, to follow Him as Lord of all the world.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Why? The answer was the resurrection of Jesus. Utterly convinced that Jesus had risen\nfrom death, His followers testified (and testify still) to the profound change He\nbrought to them. The Christian faith did not spread by armies conquering territory.\nIt spread through the transformation of individuals who then carried the message of Jesus\nto the ends of the earth. As their God was a missionary God, so Christians became a\nmissionary people.`}</p>\n    <h1>{`Getting Started`}</h1>\n    <p>{`The Christian faith is founded on the real Jesus of history.
