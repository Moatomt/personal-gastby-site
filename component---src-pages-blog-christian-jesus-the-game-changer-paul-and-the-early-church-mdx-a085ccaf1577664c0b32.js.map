Along trade routes it surged south into what is present day Ethiopia, east into present day Iraq and Iran, and its tide washed possibly as far as India. Likewise, it ran swiftly westward to Spain and modern France.`}</p>\n    <p>{`A key player in these early days was a Jew named Saul, later renamed Paul. Originally a violent persecutor of Jesus' followers, Saul underwent an abrupt, dramatic, 180 degree conversion. This experience turned him from a fanatical persecutor of Jesus into a courageous and passionate promoter of His message. And with that message he led a movement that spread out across the globe. Travelling back and forth across the Mediterranean, planting small groups of new Christians, writing letters to those churches, setting an example of mission work, Paul established the pattern for following generations of believers to take the message of Jesus to the ends of the earth.`}</p>\n    <h1>{`Getting Started`}</h1>\n    <p>{`Read the three accounts of Paul's dramatic conversion found in Acts 9:1-19, 22:1-21 and 26:9-23.`}</p>\n    <h1>{`Reflection`}</h1>\n    <p>{`Jesus taught and practised that all people mattered equally to God.
