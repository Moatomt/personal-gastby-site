# Introduction

Today, Ireland is a popular tourist destination but back in the 5th century AD, Ireland was viewed as "the land of the setting sun" by those who lived in Britain, as it was abandoned by the Roman Empire. Romans thought that there was nothing beyond it. It was a "patchwork of rival kingships" and its people followed a pagan, druidic religion. It was wild and untamed.

Early in the 5th century, a teenage boy named Patrick arrived in this frontier land. The son of a Christian in Britain, he was the victim of human trafficking. Enslaved for around six years he finally escaped back to England. In spite of his harsh experiences, he returned to his home country a transformed young man, with a deep, committed faith in Jesus. In the end, nearly twenty years later, this commitment led him to return to the land of his slave-traders. This time he came as a missionary, determined to carry the message of Jesus to the ends of the earth in Ireland.

So began a remarkable 400 year period in the history of Christianity in Europe. It is a story that in many ways is the account of how Ireland 'saved' Europe as the Roman Empire crumbled in the West. It is the story of a transformed life that led to a transformed culture.

# Getting Started

Imagine yourself as a teenager, wrenched from home and enslaved in a rough, inhospitable place far away. What would be the likely outcomes for you in terms of your attitude to life and to those around you?

# Reflection

Read the story of Joseph in Genesis 37:1-36.

What parallels do you see with Patrick's story? What lessons might be learnt from both?

# Discussion

1. What surprises you about the story of St Patrick? What most impresses you about his story?
2. Consider the story of Onesimus, a converted slave, in Philemon 1:4-21. What transformations, for Onesimus, Paul and for Philemon occurred because of his conversion to Jesus?
3. Patrick wrote about going "to the ends of the earth, to the place beyond which no one lives ..."\[Marcus Losack\], with the news about Jesus. How might we think about that today?
4. Discuss these words by Joe Turner at the end of the episode: "... I came to know the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords who came ... and who would have come just for me. That made me a somebody".
5. What were the changes that happened in Joe's life because he came to faith in Jesus? If you are a follower of Jesus what changes has He made in you? If you are not a follower of Jesus, but there would be some changes you would like to see within yourself, what would they be?
6. Read 2 Corinthians 5:16-21. What are the key ideas in this passage?
7. Why is the message from God, "I love you" so powerful?
8. Read John 1:14. What does the grace of God mean to you?
