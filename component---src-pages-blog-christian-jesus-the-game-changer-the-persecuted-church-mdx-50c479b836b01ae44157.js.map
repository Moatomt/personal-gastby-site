It runs like a scarlet thread through all the history of the Church. From their earliest days, followers of Jesus have faced varying degrees of oppression, opposition, and violence at different periods. In the end, this is because of their ultimate allegiance to Jesus. He predicted that this would be the case (John 15:18-20). Acts 5, 6 & 7 recorded that it swiftly became a reality.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The causes of persecution vary. Other religions oppose the expansion of Christianity, or even the presence of Christian people. Totalitarian governments wanting ultimate allegiance from their citizens seek to crush Christians whose final loyalties are with Jesus. Alternative worldviews fight against Christian values that confront them. Power-hungry groups threaten Christians who seek to support justice or freedom for all. Levels of persecution also vary; from outright, sometimes mortal, violence, through legislated restrictions, to mockery or ridicule.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Whatever the cause or level of persecution, it will occur as followers of Jesus seek to share His message to the ends of the earth. And often, we will discover that persecution can lead to growth in the life of the Church.`}</p>\n    <h1>{`Getting Started`}</h1>\n    <p>{`Read John 15:18-16:4, Acts 5:17-42; 6:8-7:5`}</p>\n    <h1>{`Reflection`}</h1>\n    <p>{`Think about this statement by Karl, at the commencement of the episode: `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`\"In the 20th Century, potentially more people lost their lives than any time before that for the message of Jesus.
