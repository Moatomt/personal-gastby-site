# Introduction

By 2050, half the world's population growth is projected to occur in Africa. It is a huge continent. It covers 30.37 million square kilometres of the earth's surface. There are 54 different nations. It is home to over 1.216 billion people. In 1900AD the number of African Christians was estimated at around 9 million. By 2000AD that number had increased to 380 million. It continues to grow. Some estimates are that there will be 633 million Christian believers by 2025.

The presence of Christian believers on the African continent stretches right back to within mere decades of Jesus' life. Ethiopia was likely the first region to have a native Jesus-follower (Acts 8:26-39). Other early disciples were probably from African soil also (Acts 13:1) - Lucius of Cyrene (a Greek colony in modern day Libya) and Simeon (called Niger, a reference to dark skin colour). For 400 years from around 200AD, Christianity was the dominant religion across north Africa until the Muslim invasions of the late 7th and early 8th centuries. In later centuries, Christian faith followed European traders south around the bulge of West Africa, planting itself on African soil in new locations.

The biggest explosion, in number of Christian believers, has happened in the last 250 years. Missionaries from the northern half of the globe risked health, left family and gave their lives to share the Good News of Jesus with the African south. As Western colonialism ended, the Church expanded swiftly. Now, African Christians are beginning to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth in post-Christian Europe and beyond.
# Getting Started

In the 19th century Africa was labelled as the 'dark continent' by Europeans. Its interior was still extensively unknown. Its inhabitants were dark skinned. When you think of Africa today, what are the characteristics that you most commonly attribute to it?

# Reflection

Read and reflect upon Matthew 28:16-20 and Acts 1:7-8.

How would you respond to a call to work in a place where, if you were a foreign worker, the mortality rate was roughly 70% in the first five years?

# Discussion

1. Read the account of the conversion of the African traveller in Acts 8:26-39. Why do you think this story is included in the text of Scripture? What do you take from it about Christian mission?

2. What is one fact, from this episode, that has struck you in regard to Christian faith in Africa?

3. What about David Livingstone's life and work is...
    * impressive?
    * challenging?
    * confronting?
    * disappointing?

4. Jay Milbrandt noted that David Livingstone, at the end of his life probably saw himself as a failure. Why was that the case? In what way was he "successful"? How are we to measure success in efforts to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth?

5. Jessie Fubara-Manuel says: *"Mary (Slessor) herself had times when she doubted her call. But ... she didn't give up."* Why did Mary (and many other missionaries) not give up?

6. How does Israel Olofinjana's phrase *"Africans reaching out to Africans"*, as exampled in the story of Samuel Ajayi Crowther, point us to important mission principles?

7. Why, do you think, African Christianity really start growing strongly after the end of Western colonialism and the beginning of political independence for African nations?

8. What does James McKeown's story tell us about the *"power of one"*, under God's leadership and with a passion for Jesus?

9. Read Revelation 3:14-22. In light of what this episode reveals about Africa, how might this passage be pertinent to the Western Church?

# Action

Consider this comment by Opoku Onyinah: *"We people in Africa think that the Church in the West now is really suffering. And we keep on praying that God will raise apostles, prophets and evangelists who will be able to break through and revive the Church."* How do you feel about and respond to the sentiments expressed by Opoku?
