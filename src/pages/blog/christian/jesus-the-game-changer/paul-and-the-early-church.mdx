# Introduction

Within seventy years of Jesus' death and resurrection, the movement that began with Him had spread with great rapidity. Along trade routes it surged south into what is present day Ethiopia, east into present day Iraq and Iran, and its tide washed possibly as far as India. Likewise, it ran swiftly westward to Spain and modern France.

A key player in these early days was a Jew named Saul, later renamed Paul. Originally a violent persecutor of Jesus' followers, Saul underwent an abrupt, dramatic, 180 degree conversion. This experience turned him from a fanatical persecutor of Jesus into a courageous and passionate promoter of His message. And with that message he led a movement that spread out across the globe. Travelling back and forth across the Mediterranean, planting small groups of new Christians, writing letters to those churches, setting an example of mission work, Paul established the pattern for following generations of believers to take the message of Jesus to the ends of the earth.

# Getting Started

Read the three accounts of Paul's dramatic conversion found in Acts 9:1-19, 22:1-21 and 26:9-23.

# Reflection

Jesus taught and practised that all people mattered equally to God. Paul announced, "the idea that Christ died for all of humanity." The accompanying truth was that "there is no Jew or Greek" (Galatians 5:26-29), "... that difference is dissolved..." [Tom Holland]. In what ways were these ideas revolutionary, when they emerged? How much do they still matter today to
* a) followers of Jesus,
* b) Western culture
* c) the wider world

Have you ever encountered the kind of 'Damascus road' experience that Saul (Paul) underwent? Do you accept it, question it, doubt it or embrace it?

# Discussion

1. Karl lists four factors that he sees as important for the swift spread of Christian faith to the ends of the earth.
    1. the validity of Jesus' life
    2. the evidence for Him being the Son of God, not just another religious teacher
    3. Jesus 'sending' His followers into the world; and
    4. the power of the spirit in people's lives

What do you think about this argument?

2. Dana Roberts considers the concept of a "network" or "chain" in the life of each of Jesus' followers, linking them, ultimately, back to Jesus, His people the Jews and His call from God.

In your group, share the various chain links that have brought you to this point in your faith journey.

3. A key link in the chain that formed the spread of early Christianity was the radical conversion of Saul from fanatical persecutor of Christians to passionate promoter of their faith. Read the story of that conversion in Acts 9:1-19a.

How do you react to this account?

4. Read Romans 15:23-33. What strikes you about this personal expression of Paul's life work?

5. Tom Holland indicates that Paul's decisive teaching was that "Christ died for all of humanity. So not just the Jews... there is no Jew or Greek ... that difference is dissolved, that Christ has come for the whole of humanity..."

Why was this such a transformative concept? Why might it be of great relevance to our world today?

6. In the episode, Mark Noll makes this comment: "Early Christianity spread, yes because the message was effective, yes because the person of Jesus was attractive but perhaps mostly because Christians were simply there, ... to do acts of kindness, humanity, outreach in situations where Roman culture did not smile favourably on that kind of person-to-person, group-to-group outreach."

After reading 1 Peter 3:13-17, discuss Mark's observation linking message and action in the early spread of the Church.

7. How was the favouring of Christianity under the Emperor Constantine a good thing or a bad thing for the spread of the faith?

8. How do you react to Hassan John's narrative in the episode? How would you apply the lessons in your cultural setting, especially if there is no overt physical danger or persecution?

# Action

Spend some time this week identifying and making notes about key features of the cultural groups (e.g work, neighbourhood, sporting group, hobby group) among which you live beyond 'church-world'.

Identify some intentional "acts of kindness, humanity, outreach" that you can practice in those groups. Choose one and do it. Pray for the opportunity to share the mesage of Jesus alongside the action taken.
