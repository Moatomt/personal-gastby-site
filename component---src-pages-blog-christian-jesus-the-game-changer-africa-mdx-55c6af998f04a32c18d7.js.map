It is a huge continent. It covers 30.37 million square kilometres of the earth's surface. There are 54 different nations. It is home to over 1.216 billion people. In 1900AD the number of African Christians was estimated at around 9 million. By 2000AD that number had increased to 380 million. It continues to grow. Some estimates are that there will be 633 million Christian believers by 2025.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The presence of Christian believers on the African continent stretches right back to within mere decades of Jesus' life. Ethiopia was likely the first region to have a native Jesus-follower (Acts 8:26-39). Other early disciples were probably from African soil also (Acts 13:1) - Lucius of Cyrene (a Greek colony in modern day Libya) and Simeon (called Niger, a reference to dark skin colour). For 400 years from around 200AD, Christianity was the dominant religion across north Africa until the Muslim invasions of the late 7th and early 8th centuries. In later centuries, Christian faith followed European traders south around the bulge of West Africa, planting itself on African soil in new locations.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The biggest explosion, in number of Christian believers, has happened in the last 250 years. Missionaries from the northern half of the globe risked health, left family and gave their lives to share the Good News of Jesus with the African south. As Western colonialism ended, the Church expanded swiftly. Now, African Christians are beginning to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth in post-Christian Europe and beyond.`}</p>\n    <h1>{`Getting Started`}</h1>\n    <p>{`In the 19th century Africa was labelled as the 'dark continent' by Europeans.
