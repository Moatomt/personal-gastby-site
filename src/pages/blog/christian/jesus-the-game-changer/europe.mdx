# Introduction

In this episode, Karl confesses that his thinking about early medieval monks and monasticism has been radically readjusted. Rather than seeing them as wanting to withdraw and isolate, we discover that they were instrumental in taking the Gospel to England and Europe in the 6th-10th centuries AD. This is especially the case with Irish monasticism, beginning with Patrick. The establishment of this 'Celtic' expression of Christianity proved to be a fertile ground for a line of Irish missionary monks - St. Patrick, St. Aidan, St. Columbus, St. Columbanus, St. Boniface.

These monks bravely carried the Christian message to what was then 'pagan' Europe - Scotland, England, France, Germany, Scandinavia. They did so in the face of great physical danger, both natural and human-made. Whether facing Viking attacks on their monasteries, or confronting pagan religious powers, they gave birth to vibrant, transformational, reproducing Christian communities across the western European continent.

Their missionary strategy? It was simple yet powerful: *to plant communities of dedicated people, monasteries, ... to show a local community by teaching, integrity of life and example of living what the Christian faith should mean. So, at their best, the monasteries were not just declarations of the Christian faith but exemplifications of the Christian faith."* \[Mark Noll\]

There are, doubtless, lessons we can learn from these monks as we too face the challenge of taking the message of Jesus to the ends of the earth, especially in a re-paganised Western culture.

# Getting Started

When you think of monks, what characteristics have typically come to your mind?

Have there been aspects of the stories in this episode that have surprised you?

# Reflection

Read Ephesians 2:1-13; 1 Peter 1:13-2:3.

The letters of Paul and Peter in the New Testament were written to people whose way of life had been turned around by Jesus Christ whom they followed as Lord. Think about how the truths in these verses were exemplified in some of the stories from this episode.

Do you thin, that, like the Christianised Roman Empire, we in the West can tend to believe that Christianity is coterminous (linked) with the West, and so tend to ignore what is happening in the rest of the world?

# Discussion

1. How do you respond to the narrative of this episode, that in many ways, Celtic \[Irish\] Christianity 'saved' Europe for the Christian faith?
2. Mark Noll indicates that the Irish monks did some "pretty wild things" in their missionary work. Our society, and often the Church, is much more risk averse. What are the implications for the ongoing call to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth in our day?
3. Eddie Arthur, in this episode, describes the Celtic monks as *"pilgrims for Jesus"*. What do you think he means by this, and how well does it resonate, or not, with how you see yourself in our culture, if you are a follower of Jesus?
4. Why is the story of the Vikings illustrative of the overall narrative of the spread of Christianity to the ends of the earth?
5. Mark Noll says that Boniface was *"an effective confrontational voice for Christian faith."* Ed Stetzer confirms that he *"wasn't this quiet figure."* How do you think that Christians today should balance confrontational and non-confrontational approaches to declaring the message of Jesus to our culture?
6. Irish Christianity was rural and decentralised, whereas the Roman Empire was urbanised and central. How applicable is this to our current culture?
7. The monks' missionary strategy was to plant Christian communities as examples of how to live the Christian life and why it was better. As you think about our era, what strategies do you think should be adopted?

# Action

Celtic Christian monasticism had important components of prayerful withdrawal and isolation in natural settings, along with commitment to community, learning and mission. In the coming weeks, try setting aside one or more times for a significant period of prayer and reflection (say at least half an hour) in a quiet, natural setting. Leave your phone off for that period. At the end of this time, note any matters about God, self, others that come to mind.
