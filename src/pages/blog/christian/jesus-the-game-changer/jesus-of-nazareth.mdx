# Introduction

In current times, Christianity is not the only global religion.
Accelerated in part by modern communication systems and migration, a handful of other faiths
have spread around the globe. Christianity, however, claims the largest number of adherents.

So, what is different about Christian faith in its early and current global, transformative
reach? A key answer is the one who is the centre of its worship and loyalty, Jesus. From an
obscure Jewish village in a small first century AD Roman province, Jesus emerged and over a
three year period was hailed as the expected Jewish Messiah. There were others who claimed
that title. They all faded out or were executed. Their efforts ended there.

In the end, Jesus too was executed by the Romans in a profoundly brutal, shameful way
(crucifixion). It should have ended there. It didn't. Jesus' followers soon began to
boldly call all people, not just Jews, to follow Him as Lord of all the world.

Why? The answer was the resurrection of Jesus. Utterly convinced that Jesus had risen
from death, His followers testified (and testify still) to the profound change He
brought to them. The Christian faith did not spread by armies conquering territory.
It spread through the transformation of individuals who then carried the message of Jesus
to the ends of the earth. As their God was a missionary God, so Christians became a
missionary people.

# Getting Started

The Christian faith is founded on the real Jesus of history. Read the following
New Testament passages that introduce us to this person:

*Luke 1:1-4; 3:21-23; John 1:1-14; Philippians 2:6-11; Colossians 1:15-20;
Hebrews 1:1-3;*

# Reflection

What are your earliest memories of hearing about Jesus and what did you hear?

As you read the above passages, what impresses you about what is recorded
concerning Jesus?

# Discussion

1. Discuss the relative importance of the following components for an authentic Christian life:
    1. a set of moral values
    2. the nature, person and work of Jesus
    3. a community/church experience
    4. a religious experience
2. What would it matter for the Christian faith if it was proved that Jesus' resurrection was not true?
3. The participants in the episode point to at least four key things that made and make Jesus such a transformative figure worldwide:
    - His teaching on the value and equality of all people -"*each individual was beloved of God.*" \[Lynn Cohick\]
    - the death of Jesus on the cross - "*this symbol of death ultimately becomes a symbol of new life.*" \[Ed Stetzer\]
    - the resurrection of Jesus - "*the cornerstone of our faith... Jesus is alive, He is also Lord of the universe.*" \[Craig Keener\]
    - Jesus' continuing impact on people today - "*He changed my life and that's the way I see Jesus as the Game Changer.*" \[Maryam Rostampour\]
    
    Why are these so important? Which is most or least persuasive for you?

4. Read 1 Corinthians 15:12-19. What does this passage have to say about the
implications of the resurrection for Christian faith?
5. Read Psalm 67 and John 3:16-21. In the episode, Ermias Mamo makes this observation:
"*When we see the whole Scripture, we realise God is a missionary God. And the 
Bible is a missionary book. The things He taught, the task He has given to the Church.
Go and preach the Gospel. Make disciples.*" What motivations do you discover from the
passages and the episode that encourage you to take up the mission of Jesus?
6. How do you respond to Maryam and Marziyeh's story of coming to faith in Jesus,
being changed by Him, and deciding to share that with their friends and family in
spite of the danger?

# Action
In the coming week, make time to read through or listen to the whole of Mark's Gospel,
in one sitting if possible.

Spend some time this week developing a two sentence, memorable ending to one of the
following statements:

* "I am a follower of Jesus because..."
OR
* "I am interested in knowing more about Jesus because..."
OR
* "I am curious about the person of Jesus because..."
