# Introduction

Persecution is defined as "harassment, oppression or maltreatment" because of race, religion or belief. It runs like a scarlet thread through all the history of the Church. From their earliest days, followers of Jesus have faced varying degrees of oppresion, opposition, and violence at different periods. In the end, this is because of their ultimate allegiance to Jesus. He predicted that this would be the case (John 15:18-20). Acts 5, 6 & 7 recorded that it swifly became a reality.

The causes of persecution vary. Other religions oppose the expansion of Christianity, or even the presence of Christian people. Totalitarian governments wanting ultimate allegiance from their citizens seek to crush Christians whose final loyalties are with Jesus. Alternative worldviews fight against Christian values that confront them. Power-hungry groups threaten Christians who seek to support justice or freedom for all. Levels of persecution also vary; from outright, sometimes mortal, violence, through legislated restrictions, to mockery or ridicule.

Whatever the cause or level of persecution, it will occur as followers of Jesus seek to share His message to the ends of the earth. And often, we will discover that persecution can lead to growth in the life of the Church.
# Getting Started

Read John 15:18-16:4, Acts 5:17-42; 6:8-7:5

# Reflection

This about this statement by Karl, at the commencement of the episode: *"In the 20th Century, potentially more people lost their lives than any time before that for the message of Jesus. It tells us that when people have taken the message of Jesus to the ends of the earth, people have paid for it with their lives."*

What feelings and thoughts do you have when you read this?
# Discussion

1. As Brian Stanley observes, for Christians, persecution can be an outcome of their ultimate allegiance to Jesus. Why is this the case and can you think of Biblical examples?

2. Read the story of Peter and John in Acts 4:1-20. What does this incident say to us and our churches today?

3. One command of God is to share Jesus with others. In some countries this is forbidden. What other commands of Scripture might invite persecution and oppression, whether by governments, family or other people?

4. Christians in the West today, often decry the rise of secularism. Why is living in a secular state a benefit when it comes to potential persecution for being a Christian?

5. How do you respond to the stories of Nii Amoo Darku, Maryam Rostampour, Marziyeh Amirizadeh and Hassan John about the experience of Christians in some Muslim countries?

6. Talk about this comment by Mike Gore: *"But when I look at my own life I feel that the relative safety of culture and the stability of the economic climate that I've grown up in, when I look back it makes it more and more difficult to see where the hand of Jesus has been, the highs and the lows. Whereas in the Persecuted Church, they can speak to you for days, for hours, about what Jesus is to them, what He's done in their life, the transformation He brings, why He matters to you."*

7. The Chinese pastor makes this comment to Mike Gore: "Well, we look at the Australian Church as a prophetic example of what happens when faith becomes free ... the value of Jesus drops. I was you to pray persecution never leaves China."

How do you react to that observation?

8. What, in your opinion, are the main threats to authentic Christian faith in the West?

9. Marziyeh makes this significant comment: *"We can't enjoy just our freedom and forget about those who are still in prison."*

How does this inform your response to the fact that Christians are persecuted all around the world for their (and our) faith?
