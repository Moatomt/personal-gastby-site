# Troubles
So I've been having some trouble with markdown + JSX producing different HTML to what is specified in Markdown Specifications. I've documented some of the weirdness I've encountered to prevent myself from being super stumped again. It took me a couple hours to figure this out as I thought it was potentially due to missing npm dependencies, conflicting npm package versions, or even my css.

## Nested lists

I found the MDX producing HTML code tags when using nested lists, specifically when I had written my single paragraphs across multiple lines. The parts in question looked like this:
```
1. Discuss the relative importance of the following components
for an authentic Christian life:
    1. a set of moral values
    2. the nature, person and work of Jesus
    3. a community/church experience
    4. a religious experience
```
Which would render as such:
1. Discuss the relative importance of the following components
for an authentic Christian life:
    1. a set of moral values
    2. the nature, person and work of Jesus
    3. a community/church experience
    4. a religious experience

instead of as:
1. Discuss the relative importance of the following components for an authentic Christian life:
    1. a set of moral values
    2. the nature, person and work of Jesus
    3. a community/church experience
    4. a religious experience

It would fix itself when I combined the first sentence into one line but this would render correctly on vscode's inbuilt markdown preview.

Similarly I had another problem with a nested unordered list. The following would create a nested code block instead of a nested unordered list.

```
3. The participants in the episode point to at least four key things that made and make Jesus such a transformative figure worldwide:
    - His teaching on the value and equality of all people -"*each individual was beloved of God.*" \[Lynn Cohick\]
    - the death of Jesus on the cross - "*this symbol of death ultimately becomes a symbol of new life.*" \[Ed Stetzer\]
    - the resurrection of Jesus - "*the cornerstone of our faith... Jesus is alive, He is also Lord of the universe.*" \[Craig Keener\]
    - Jesus' continuing impact on people today - "*He changed my life and that's the way I see Jesus as the Game Changer.*" \[Maryam Rostampour\]
Why are these so important? Which is most or least persuasive for you?

Adding an extra line between the last list item and the last two sentences and a tab fixed it but made all the ordered list items be enclosed in paragraph tags (as is expected in markdown). i.e
