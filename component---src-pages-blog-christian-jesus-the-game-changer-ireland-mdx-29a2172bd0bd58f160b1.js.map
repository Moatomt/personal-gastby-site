Romans thought that there was nothing beyond it. It was a \"patchwork of rival kingships\" and its people followed a pagan, druidic religion. It was wild and untamed.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Early in the 5th century, a teenage boy named Patrick arrived in this frontier land. The son of a Christian in Britain, he was the victim of human trafficking. Enslaved for around six years he finally escaped back to England. In spite of his harsh experiences, he returned to his home country a transformed young man, with a deep, committed faith in Jesus. In the end, nearly twenty years later, this commitment led him to return to the land of his slave-traders. This time he came as a missionary, determined to carry the message of Jesus to the ends of the earth in Ireland.`}</p>\n    <p>{`So began a remarkable 400 year period in the history of Christianity in Europe. It is a story that in many ways is the account of how Ireland 'saved' Europe as the Roman Empire crumbled in the West. It is the story of a transformed life that led to a transformed culture.`}</p>\n    <h1>{`Getting Started`}</h1>\n    <p>{`Imagine yourself as a teenager, wrenched from home and enslaved in a rough, inhospitable place far away.
